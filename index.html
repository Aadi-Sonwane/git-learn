        <h1>GitHub</h1>
        <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.</p>
        <p>This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests. You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.</p>
        <p>No coding necessary</p>
        <p>To complete this tutorial, you need a GitHub.com account and Internet access. You don’t need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software GitHub is built on).</p>
        <p>Tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We recommend the first time you try this tutorial, you use the sandbox. The sandbox is a preconfigured environment for learning and experimenting. It has no GitHub profile associated with it, so you can stay completely anonymous. You can only create one sandbox at a time.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you choose to use your own account, you may want to create a new GitHub account for this tutorial. If you use your personal account, you may receive unwanted email from other GitHub users.
            </li>
        </ul>
